# TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2025 - Write-ups 🎄

This repository contains my write-ups for the **TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2025**. This collection documents my journey through a 24-day cybersecurity challenge designed to simulate real-world attacks and defensive strategies.

## 📖 About This Repo

This repository serves as a comprehensive log of the techniques, tools, and methodologies I learned and applied during the event. Each file corresponds to a daily challenge, breaking down the investigation into:

* **Scenario Analysis:** Understanding the specific threat (e.g., Ransomware, Phishing, ICS compromise).
* **Technical Walkthrough:** Step-by-step execution of the exploit or forensic investigation.
* **Tools & Concepts:** Explanations of the software (Splunk, Burp Suite, Docker, AWS CLI) and security principles used.
* **Mitigation:** Key takeaways on how to defend against these specific vectors.

## 🎯 Topics Covered

The challenges provided hands-on experience across the entire security spectrum, including:
* **Web Application Security:** XSS, SQLi, Race Conditions, and API Exploitation.
* **Blue Team & Forensics:** Log analysis (Splunk/Zeek), Malware Reverse Engineering, and Registry Forensics.
* **Cloud & Infrastructure:** AWS Privilege Escalation, Docker Breakouts, and SCADA/ICS Security.
* **Scripting & Automation:** Python, Bash, YARA rules, and PowerShell de-obfuscation.
