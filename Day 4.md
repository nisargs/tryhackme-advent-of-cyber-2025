# Day 4: AI in Security - Old sAInt Nick

## 📝 Scenario
In Day 4, "The Best Festival Company" (TBFC) began trialing a new AI assistant named **Van SolveIT** to improve efficiency during the busy Christmas season. 

My objective was to evaluate the efficacy of AI in cybersecurity by using this assistant across three distinct domains: **Offensive Security (Red Team)**, **Defensive Security (Blue Team)**, and **Software Security**. The goal was to understand how AI can accelerate workflows while recognizing the need for human verification.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used
* **Van SolveIT:** A custom AI chatbot designed for cybersecurity tasks.
* **Python:** Used to execute the exploit script generated by the AI.
* **AI-Assisted SAST:** Static Application Security Testing performed by the AI to audit code.
* **Log Analysis:** AI-driven interpretation of web server logs.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Investigation Walkthrough

### Phase 1: Red Team (Exploitation)
The first challenge was to act as an attacker. I tasked the AI agent with generating an exploit script for a known vulnerability in the target environment.
* **Action:** I requested an exploit for the specific web application.
* **Result:** The AI generated a Python script.
* **Human-in-the-Loop:** I reviewed the code and identified that the target IP address needed to be manually updated. I modified the script to target `MACHINE_IP:5000`.
* **Execution:** I ran the script from the terminal, which successfully exploited the service and returned a flag.

### Phase 2: Blue Team (Log Analysis)
Next, I switched roles to a defender. I provided the AI with web server logs to identify the attack I had just performed (or a similar one).
* **Action:** The AI parsed the logs to look for anomalies.
* **Result:** It successfully identified suspicious IP addresses and User-Agent strings, demonstrating how AI can act as a Tier 1 analyst to filter noise and surface alerts.

### Phase 3: Software Development (Secure Code Review)
Finally, I used the AI to review a snippet of source code.
* **Action:** The AI performed a Static Analysis (SAST) on the provided code block.
* **Result:** It highlighted specific lines of code that were vulnerable to common exploits (such as SQL Injection or Remote Code Execution) and suggested remediation steps.

## 🧠 Key Takeaways
* **AI as an Accelerator:** The AI significantly reduced the time required to write boilerplate exploit code and parse dense logs.
* **Verification is Critical:** The exercise highlighted that AI output cannot be blindly trusted. The exploit script required manual modification (setting the correct IP/Port) to function, reinforcing the concept that AI is a "Co-pilot," not an "Auto-pilot."
* **Multidisciplinary Application:** AI is not limited to one niche; it effectively bridged the gap between offensive, defensive, and development tasks.
